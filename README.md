# AdvancedTriviaGame

Start the Trivia game by clicking the Start button as game loads initially.

Then you are shown the first question. There are a total of 5 questions in my version of this game.
You have 25 seconds to answer each question.

If you have correctly answered the question within 25 seconds, then a message is displayed 
a. stating that the choice was CORRECT.
b. the timer also stops

If you have incorrectly answered the question within 25 seconds, then a message is displayed 
a. stating that the choice was INCORRECT. The correct answer is also shown.
b. the timer also stops.

If you don't answer the question within 25 seconds, then a message is displayed 
a. stating that the user is out of time! The correct answer is also shown.
b. the timer shows the time left as 0 secs.

After every question attempt/non attempt, results for that question are displayed as stated above
and that is shown for 5 seconds. After that without any user input, the next question is displayed.

This continues till you attempt the last question. After you see the results for the last question, you will
see a summary of the entire run/iteration of the game for that session. This will have the below metrics,
a. How many were answered correctly?
b. How many were unanswered?
c. How many were answered incorrectly?
There is also a Start Over button below the metrics information. If the user clicks it, then the game resets 
and starts over without any page refreshes.
